# Portfolio
Hello, Iâ€™m Matt Teixeira; a full-stack developer. I have been working as a backend developer since 2022, where I have honed my skills in building scalable ETL (Extract - Transform - Load) pipelines. Prior to transitioning from the field of environmental science into software development, I worked as a remediation scientist and data analyst where I developed novel tools and applications to facilitate the unique challenges associated with groundwater contamination cleanup. 

I'm passionate about creating excellent software that improves
the lives of those around me. I specialize in developng tools for
niche processes and applications. With each project, my aim is to provide a
solution for the problem at hand. What could your team accomplish
with a developer to your side?
